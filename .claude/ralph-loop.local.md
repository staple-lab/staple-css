 plan and also implement this needs to be worldclass npm library for creating consistentcy with your design, we need many more css types to be ble to configure, and I want it to be described as token system that can enforce consistency for your LLMS, add in the token generator allowed values for the grids flex etc, good defaults but allow other values too and in the readme make sure tis update as per the latest apis with breakpoints, then Lets up the site to be world class (better than Tailwinds in stlye and functionality, explanation, add a llms.txt, last step i need you to update the copy and description in the readme and in the website, remove the reference to claude, and add storybook for all the components and integrate it into the token generated some how, but basically you export a theme, its able to be used and treehshaken in your conumer app
