INTERACTIVE PLAYGROUND SECTION
==============================
Try It Live
Interact with real components. Switch examples, view code, tweak props.

CORE PRINCIPLES
===============
Thoughtful design decisions that guide every feature.

Tokens are the API
Design decisions live in tokens. Components consume token keys, not arbitrary raw values. This enforces consistency by default.

Contract Over Customization
A stable, constrained API enables consistency. Override by design via className, not by default. This reduces decision fatigue.

Zero Runtime Overhead
All CSS is static. No JavaScript style generation. No CSS-in-JS overhead. Minimum bundle size, maximum performance.
