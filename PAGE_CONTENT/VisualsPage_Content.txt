===========
Visual System & Design Language
Comprehensive visual guidelines including icons, illustrations, shadows, and motion. Create beautiful, cohesive interfaces with consistent visual language.

ELEVATION SYSTEM (SHADOWS)
===========================
Six elevation levels (0-5) for depth and hierarchy. Each level represents a specific vertical distance, creating visual structure and focus.

ELEVATION LEVELS:

Level 0
Flat - No shadow
shadow-0

Level 1
Subtle - Minimal elevation
shadow-1

Level 2
Raised - Card elevation
shadow-2

Level 3
Floating - Dropdown/modal
shadow-3

Level 4
Lifted - Emphasis
shadow-4

Level 5
Prominent - Top layer
shadow-5

BORDER RADIUS SCALE
===================
Four-step radius scale for consistency. Each level creates specific visual effects from subtle to highly rounded.

| Description | Size | Token |
| Sharp | 0px | radius-0 |
| Subtle | 2px | radius-1 |
| Standard | 4px | radius-2 |
| Soft | 8px | radius-3 |
| Round | 16px | radius-4 |

GRADIENT SHOWCASE
=================
Visual examples of all gradient tokens. Use for hero sections, backgrounds, and visual emphasis.

Available Gradients:
- Sunrise
- Sunset
- Ocean
- Forest
- Grape
- Mint

MOTION & TRANSITIONS
====================
Smooth, purposeful motion that guides attention and creates responsive feedback. Always under 300ms for perceived performance.

MOTION PATTERNS:

Fade In
Gentle appearance animation
Duration: 200ms

Slide Up
Entrance from bottom
Duration: 300ms

Scale
Growth from center
Duration: 250ms

Bounce
Playful arrival
Duration: 500ms

TYPOGRAPHY SCALE
=================
Seven-step font scale with intentional hierarchy. Each size has a specific purpose in the visual hierarchy.

| Size | Label | Usage |
| 0 | 12px - XS | Extra small for captions |
| 1 | 14px - SM | Small for secondary text |
| 2 | 16px - Base | Base size for body copy |
| 3 | 18px - LG | Large for subheadings |
| 4 | 20px - XL | Extra large for headings |
| 5 | 24px - 2XL | 2XL for section headings |
| 6 | 32px - 3XL | 3XL for page titles |

SPACING SCALE VISUALIZATION
============================
Nine-step spacing scale from 0 to 4rem. Use consistently for padding, margins, and gaps.

| Token | Value | Label |
| 0 | 0px | space-0 |
| 1 | 4px | space-1 |
| 2 | 8px | space-2 |
| 3 | 12px | space-3 |
| 4 | 16px | space-4 |
| 5 | 24px | space-5 |
| 6 | 32px | space-6 |
| 7 | 48px | space-7 |
| 8 | 64px | space-8 |

INTERACTIVE STATES
==================
Consistent state patterns for buttons, links, and form elements. Always provide visual feedback for interactions.

DEFAULT STATE
Base state, ready for interaction

HOVER STATE
User hovers over element, shows readiness

ACTIVE STATE
Element is being clicked/pressed

DISABLED STATE
Element is unavailable for interaction

VISUAL ACCESSIBILITY
====================
Comprehensive accessibility considerations for visual design.

COLOR CONTRAST
--------------
All text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum) for readability

CLEAR FOCUS
-----------
Focus indicators are highly visible (2px outline, 2px offset)

REDUCED MOTION
--------------
Respects prefers-reduced-motion preference for safer interactions

TOUCH TARGETS
-------------
Interactive elements are 44px minimum (32px on mobile)

NOT COLOR ALONE
---------------
Information is conveyed with icons, patterns, and text too

READABLE TEXT
-------------
Line height and length optimized for dyslexia-friendly reading
