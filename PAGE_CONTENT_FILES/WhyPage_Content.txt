HERO SECTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
H1: Why staple-css?
Subtitle: A styling contract that prioritizes consistency, performance, and maintainability.


CORE PHILOSOPHY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Section: Tokens are the API

Description:
Design decisions are encoded as CSS variables. When every component uses the same
spacing scale, the same color tokens, the same typography settings, your UI
naturally becomes more cohesive.

Key Points:
• Design decisions live in tokens
• Contract ensures consistency
• Centralized design system
• Design → Code traceability


PRINCIPLES (3 Cards)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Tokens are the API
   Components consume token keys, not arbitrary values.
   This enforces consistency by default.

2. Contract Over Customization
   A stable, constrained API enables consistency.
   Override by design via className, not by default.

3. Consistency by Default
   When tokens are the API, consistency happens automatically.
   No decision fatigue. No style sprawl.


PERFORMANCE-FIRST DESIGN (4 Metrics)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• 0ms Runtime Overhead
  Static CSS only. No runtime style generation.

• <1kb Runtime Size
  Zero dependencies. No CSS-in-JS bloat.

• 100% Tree-Shakeable
  Import only what you use. Components split individually.

• ~40% Fewer Media Queries
  Intrinsic responsive design with CSS Grid minmax().


LONG-TERM MAINTAINABILITY (4 Items)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Token Versioning
  Update design once, all components reflect the change.

• Centralized Design System
  Single source of truth for design decisions.

• No Style Props Hell
  Components use stable token keys, not style objects.

• Design → Code Traceability
  Every CSS value traces back to a token.


ACCESSIBILITY BUILT-IN (4 Items)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• WCAG Compliance
  Color contrast, focus states, motion respect.

• Keyboard Navigation
  All components support full keyboard access.

• Motion Respect
  @media (prefers-reduced-motion) built-in.

• Dark Mode
  Automatic light/dark theme support.
