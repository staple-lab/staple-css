## Three Pillars

### 01. Tokens First
Design decisions encoded as CSS variables. Update once, propagate everywhere. No scattered magic values.

### 02. Zero Runtime
Static CSS only. No JavaScript, no CSS-in-JS, no build-time magic. Native CSS variables the browser understands.

### 03. Ship Fast
Pre-built semantic primitives. Accessible by default. Dark mode included. Focus on features, not styling.

## Design Systems Done Right

### Consistency
When every component uses the same tokens, your UI naturally becomes cohesive. No more color variations or spacing inconsistencies.

### Maintainability
Update a token once, and it propagates everywhere. Refactoring becomes trivial. Design feedback is actionable.

### Scalability
Works for teams of 5 or 500. The token system grows with you. Add new tokens without breaking existing patterns.

### Performance
No runtime CSS generation. Static CSS loaded once. Dark mode switching is instant. Your site stays fast as you scale.

## Our Values

### Tokens are the API
Design decisions aren't scattered throughout your codebase. They live in tokens. Query them, version them, change them.

### Contract over Customization
A stable contract beats infinite customization. Teams coordinate through tokens, not through component prop sprawl.

### Performance Matters
Static CSS. Zero JavaScript overhead. Fast theme switching. Your site stays responsive as complexity grows.

### Accessibility First
WCAG AA compliance by default. Semantic HTML. Keyboard navigation. Dark mode. Not an afterthought.
