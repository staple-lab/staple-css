# Visual System & Design Language

Comprehensive visual guidelines including icons, illustrations, shadows, and motion. Create beautiful, cohesive interfaces with consistent visual language.

## Elevation System (Shadows)

Six elevation levels (0-5) for depth and hierarchy. Each level represents a specific vertical distance, creating visual structure and focus.

### Level 1
Subtle depth - For minimal lift

### Level 2
Raised elements - For cards and containers

### Level 3
Floating state - For dropdowns and tooltips

### Level 4
Emphasized layer - For modals

### Level 5
Topmost elements - For maximum prominence

---

## Border Radius Scale

Four-step radius scale for consistency. Each level creates specific visual effects from subtle to highly rounded.

### Sharp (0px)
Sharp corners (rare)

### Subtle (2px)
Subtle rounding (icons)

### Standard (4px)
Button/input elements

### Soft (8px)
Card/container default

### Round (16px)
Large, soft containers
